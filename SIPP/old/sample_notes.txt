Home equity is the main variable provided at the household level rather than the individual level.
To split this up between members of the household, dropping some observations was necessary to
discard unstable households. I took the reference member of every household and paired him/her up
with spouse, when present. If there was no spouse the full year, then the reference member
was attributed the full share of home equity. If there was a spouse for the full year, then the
share was split 50/50. I dropped any household heads that had a non-constant marriage status, and
I dropped the individual who was--at some point--the spouse of such an individual. Overall,
the final sample size was 31,270, which represents 95% of all individuals in the original sample
that were at least 15 years old and had data for all 12 months of the survey.
