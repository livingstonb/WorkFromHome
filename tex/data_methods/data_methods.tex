\section{Classification of workers by industry and/or occupation}
For mapping Census occupation and industry codes to SOC and NAICS codes, respectively, I rely on crosswalks provided by \cite{crosswalks}.

\subsection{Occupation classification}
We use a total of 94 occupation categories, consisting of all three-digit (aka minor) groups in the 2010 SOC system, with the exclusion of major group 55 known as \emph{Military Specific Occupations}. For cases in which the data are based on other classification systems, e.g. 2018 SOC or 2010 Census, we use crosswalks to reclassify workers into a 2010 minor group.

\subsection{Sector classification}
To identify a worker as belonging to sector C or sector S, we go by 2017 NAICS codes. For datasets using 2012 NAICS codes, we map 2012 industry codes into roughtly equivalent 2017 industry codes.

\section{BLS Occupational Employment Statistics}
\subsection{Data}
We use industry-specific, cross-ownership OES data downloaded from the BLS website (See \cite{OES}). For most years, separate datasets are available for different levels of industry aggregation. Depending on the context, we use the broadest level of industry aggregation possible, to reduce the likelihood of our estimates being affected by rounding error or missing values present at very fine levels of industry aggregation. 

\subsection{Aggregating occupation to 2010 SOC minor groups}
\label{OES: aggregation}
We use OES data on employment and mean wage by occupation and industry.
Depending on the year and occupation in question, OES datasets in some cases provide employment and mean wage at multiple levels of occupation aggregation, and sometimes our desired minor groups are omitted.
When estimating employment for each of our occupation categories, we first use the employment figures provided at the 2010 SOC minor level, if available. Where they are not provided, we aggregate from finer occupation groups. We do the same for the mean wage, except we take employment-weighted means as we aggregate up rather than sums.

\subsection{Aggregating by both industry and occupation}
In some cases we aggregate by both industry and occupation. We do this by separately identifying each worker with a minor 2010 SOC code and a code for industry, with the latter depending on our desired level of industry aggregation for a given estimator. Then we aggregate up as described in Section \ref{OES: aggregation}, with the change that we compute estimates conditional on both occupation and industry rather than occupation alone.

\section{ACS}
Our source for the ACS is \cite{ACS}, provided by \cite{IPUMS}.

\subsection{Sample}
We use an individual-level sample restricted to observations satisfying the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item At least 15 years of age
\item In the labor force
\item Annual earnings last year were at least \$1000
\item Worked at least 27 weeks of the previous year
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sample size}
For each year between 2013 and 2017 we have roughly 1.2 million observations with a non-missing response to the WFH question, after making the restrictions above and dropping workers in occupations or industries outside of our classifications:

\end{table}

\subsection{Variables}
\subsubsection{Weights}
For weighting, we use the PERWT variable in all estimation.

\subsubsection{WFH Question}
We classify an individual as having worked from home based on the response to the question:
\begin{quote}
How did this person usually get to work LAST WEEK?
\end{quote}
Each observation was classified as WFH if the response was:
\begin{quote}
Worked at home
\end{quote}
Otherwise the observation was classified as not a WFH worker.
These responses are provided in the variable TRANWORK.
See Figure \ref{ACS-WFH} for an example from the 2017 questionnaire.\footnote{\url{https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/methodology/questionnaires/2017/quest17.pdf}}

\section{ATUS}

\subsection{Sample}
Our sample consists of respondents to the 2017-2018 ATUS Leave Module. This module by construction excludes all non-workers and all self-employed workers. I do not impose any sample restrictions.

\subsubsection{Sample size}
Our final sample size after dropping workers outside of our industry or sector classifications or for whom WFH answers were missing is 9,456.

\subsection{Variables}

\subsubsection{Weights}
All estimates are weighted using the ATUS Leave Module variable LUFINLWGT.

\subsubsection{WFH Question}
We base our WFH statistics on the variables LUJF\_10 and LEJF\_11, which correspond to the ability to WFH in one's job, and actual WFH in one's job, respectively. These questions are as follows, with possible responses of ``Yes,'' ``No,'' and ``Don't Know'', the last of which I discard when estimating means over the given variable:
\begin{quote}
JF\_10: \\
As part of your (main) job, can you work at home?
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
JF\_11: \\
Do you ever work at home?
\end{quote}

The prefixes LE and LU denote an edited variable and an unedited variable, respectively. ATUS provides one question as edited and the other as unedited, hence the different prefixes. Since the universe of LEJF\_11 is restricted to observations with a ``Yes'' response to LUJF\_10, we recoded LEJF\_11 to imply no work from home if the value of LUJF\_10 implied being unable to work from home.

\section{SIPP}
\subsection{Sample}
We use waves 1-4 of the 2014 SIPP. The waves are treated separately when computing all intermediate variables, and then pooled prior to final estimation. We do not link individuals across waves in any way.

\subsubsection{Individual level sample}
In the individual level sample, we use all individuals of age 15 or older who were present in all 12 months of the wave.

\subsubsection{Family level sample}
Here we start with all individuals of age 15 or older who were present in all 12 months of the wave. SIPP identifies families for each month separately, and because of changes in family composition across months, we use our own definition of family at the annual frequency. We start by identifying family heads as the SIPP-designated family reference member. A family head in our definition must be the head of a family for each of the twelve months in the wave. Any members of a family in which the reference member does not satisfy this condition do not show up in any family in our sample.

A family is then defined as the group of individuals who are all in the same SIPP-designated family as the family head for all twelve months of the wave. If in individual is in the same family as the family head for only 10 months, for example, then this individual is excluded from the family unit. In these cases, only these members are dropped; the family is still included as a sampling unit but does not include such members. The exception to this is if the family head's spouse is one of these members, in which case the entire family is dropped. We also drop families if the family head's marriage status changes at any point in the year. Only a very small number of families are dropped for either of these two reasons.

In terms of SIPP variables: A family head is an individual such that the variable PNUM is equal to the variable RFAMREF. We designate an individual as a member of a head's family if the values of SSUID, ERESIDENCEID, and RFAMNUM for the individual are equal to that of the head in each month of the year. The spouse of the head in a given month, if one is present, is the individual with a value of PNUM equal to the head's value of SPOUS\_EHC. Both the spouse, if present, and the head, must show up in all twelve months of data and be married and in the same household for each month, or the family is dropped.

\subsubsection{Household level sample}
Sampling units are identified in this sample in the same way as the family level sample, except we use household reference members as the household heads and members are dropped or the entire household is dropped based on the same conditions, but with respect to the household instead of the family. Households with unstable marriage status are dropped as in the family level sample only in relation to the marriage status of the household head; married individuals in the household which are not the household head or the spouse of the household head are treated as any other individuals, that is, they are dropped individually if they are not in the same household as the head for all months of the year, but the household is still kept in the sample.

In terms of SIPP variables: A household head is an individual such that the variable PNUM is equal to the variable RFAMREF and such that RFAMNUM is equal to one. We designate an individual as a member of a head's household if the values of SSUID and ERESIDENCEID for the individual are equal to that of the head in each month of the year. The spouse of the head in a given month, if one is present, is the individual with a value of PNUM equal to the head's value of SPOUS\_EHC. Both the spouse, if present, and the head, must show up in all twelve months of data and be married and in the same household for each month, or the household is dropped.

\subsubsection{Sample size}
For computing \%WFH by occupation, we use 98,597 observations across four waves, with each observation representing one respondent-year pair. Since the source data is a panel, this amounts to 42,170 distinct individuals. These figures reflect both attrition and new entrants into existing SIPP sample units. 

\subsection{Classification of worker into occupation category}
\label{sipp_occupation}
Respondents to SIPP are allowed to provide up to seven distinct jobs, each of with is reported for the individual months out of the year during which the individual held said occupation.
For each worker-wave pair, I classify a worker as holding a given occupation by identifying one of the reported occupations as the primary occupation. I enact the following procedure for each worker-wave pair:
\begin{enumerate}
\item I make a list of all distinct occupation codes reported.
\item I compute the number of months for which each distinct occupation code is reported. If the code is repeated for multiple reported jobs in the same month, I count this just once.
\item I designate the primary occupation as the occupation code reported in the greatest number of months. If there is a tie, I choose among the most frequent codes the occupation code which was reported first.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Household and family level samples}
In the household and family level samples, the occupation of the household or family is set to the occupation of the individual in the household or family with the largest reported mean earnings.

\subsection{Classification of worker into industry category}
For industry classification I use essentially the same procedure as in Section \ref{sipp_occupation}, and I do this separately from occupation.

\subsubsection{Household and family level samples}
In the household and family level samples, the industry of the household or family is set to the industry of the individual in the household or family with the largest reported mean earnings.

\subsection{Variables}

\subsubsection{Weights}
All estimates are computed based on the provided person-level weight variable for the 2014 SIPP, which is identified as WPFINWGT.

\subsubsection{Assets and liabilities}
At the individual level, the individual level variables below are used directly. At the household and family level, an unweighted sum is taken over these variables across members of the household or family.
We use the following definitions:
\begin{align*}
\text{deposits} &= \text{saving accts} + \text{checking accts} + \text{money market funds} \\
\text{bonds} &= \text{gov bonds} + \text{municipal and corporate bonds} \\
\text{liquid assets} &= 1.05 \times (\text{deposits} + \text{bonds} + \text{stocks} + \text{mutual funds}) \\
\text{net liquid assets} &= \text{liquid assets} - \text{cc debt} \\
\text{net illiquid assets} &= \text{home equity} + \text{IRA} + \text{Keogh} + \text{CDs} + \text{life insurance}
\end{align*}
Home equity is surveyed at the household-level but SIPP provides an individual-level recode. The rest of the above variables are provided at the individual level.

\newcommand{\eqindent}{\\ \indent \hspace{4pt} = }
\newcommand{\listassets}[1]{sum(TJS{#1}VAL TJO{#1}VAL TO{#1}VAL)}

The variables we use are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Saving accounts \eqindent \listassets{SAV}
\item Interest-bearing checking accounts\eqindent  \listassets{ICHK}
\item Non-interest-bearing checking accounts\eqindent  \listassets{CHK}
\item Money market funds\eqindent  \listassets{MM}
\item Government bonds\eqindent  \listassets{GOVS}
\item Municipal and corporate bonds\eqindent  \listassets{MCBD}
\item Stocks\eqindent  \listassets{ST}
\item Mutual funds\eqindent  \listassets{MF}
\item Credit card debt = TDEBT\_CC
\item Home equity = TEQ\_HOME
\item IRA and Keogh = TIRAKEOVAL
\item CDs = \listassets{CD}
\item Life insurance = TLIFE\_CVAL
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Earnings}
Our measure of earnings is annual earnings, which we set equal to the sum of TPEARN over all twelve months of the year. We take weekly earnings to be annual earnings divided by 52. The description of this variable, taken from \cite{tpearn}, is the following:
\begin{quote}
Income earned from all jobs worked during the month, including wage and salary income, bonus payments, commissions, overtime payments, tips, other income from self-employed businesses, self-employed business profits, and accounting for time spent away from a job without pay.
\end{quote}

At the individual level, TPEARN is used directly. At the household or family level, an unweighted sum is taken over TPEARN across members of the household or family.

\subsubsection{Ratio of liquid wealth to earnings}
This statistic is just net liquid assets divided by annual earnings, conditional on annual earnings being at least \$1000.

\subsubsection{HtM in terms of earnings}
For various $x$ and $y$ in the expressions below, we compute binary indicators for HtM status for each observation. Let $b$ be net liquid assets and let $a$ be net illiquid assets.
\begin{align*}
\text{HtM} &= (a < x) \\
\text{WHtM} &= (a < x) * (b \geq y) \\
\text{PHtM} &= (a < x) * (b < y)
\end{align*}
To compute shares of individuals falling into these categories, we take weighted means of these indicators.

\subsubsection{WFH Question}
The variables we use for WFH status in SIPP are labeled EJB\#\_WSHMWRK,
where the \# represents the number of the reported job.
Each of these variables is reported for each month separately, and is reported with ``Yes'' or ``No'' responses.
The question is worded as follows\footnote{This comes from direct correspondence with the SIPP Survey Team.}:
\begin{quote}
As part of (your/name) typical work schedule for (employer name), (are/were) there any days when (you/name) (work, works, worked) only at home?
\end{quote}

\if The codebook describes this variable as the following:
\begin{quote}
Were there any days when \ldots worked only from home?
\end{quote}
and provides additional notes:
\begin{quote}
Respondents who reported days working only at home or reported working from home in combination with another form of transportation to work.
\end{quote}
\fi
To aggregate to the annual frequency, I code an individual as having worked from home if EJB\#\_WSHMWRK contains a ``Yes'' response in any job for that individual, within any of the 12 months of the year. If all responses were ``No'' then the individual is assumed to not have worked from home.
Note that this variable is based on all jobs held; some jobs may not coincide with what we designate as the primary occupation for a given worker. I did (rather quickly) look at the \%WFH-by-occupation figures when defining WFH based only on the values of EJB\#\_WSHMWR coinciding with the designated primary occupation. I didn't see large differences.

\section{Essential workers by occupation}
\subsection{Data}
Here we use a combination of data from \cite{OES} and \cite{brookings}. The appendix to \cite{brookings} provides 4-digit industry codes deemed to be essential. The OES sample used was the four-digit employment-by-industry dataset for May 2017.

\subsection{Methods}
First, each OES occupation code was mapped to a 2010 SOC minor category. Second, each four-digit industry was either mapped to the essential workers data, in which case the industry was deemed essential, or not, and the industry was classified as non-essential.
At this point we had employment, mean wage, and a binary indicator for essential industries, at the occupation-industry level. We then computed employment-weighted means to aggregate over all industries and estimate the share of each occupation in essential industries.

\section{A teleworkable index using data from Dingel and Neiman}

\subsection{Data}
Using a binary indicator of whether an occupation is \emph{teleworkable} from \cite{DN}, we aggregate up to 2010 SOC minor occupation categories.

\subsection{Methods}
Note that for some six-digit occupations, the teleworkable indicator was not provided. In these cases, the occupations with a missing indicator were ignored and we proceeded with aggregation.

We aggregated upwards starting from the finest categories possible. We took employment-weighted averages when each of the occupations listed in Dingel-Neiman had a non-missing employment estimate in OES for the given sector. Elsewhere, we took arithmetic means. 

This means that, for example, once we averaged out the SOC-O*NET occupations to 6-digit SOC codes, we might run into a case where two of the three 6-digit occupations in Dingel-Neiman for a given 5-digit occupation category have nonmissing employment estimates in OES, but one is missing in OES. In that case, we took another arithmetic mean over the teleworkable variable for these three occupations to aggregate to the 5-digit level. From there, we would then do the same thing: if all occupations in SOC at the given 5-digit category had nonmissing employment estimates in OES, we would use an employment-weighted mean of teleworkable at the current aggregation level to aggregate upward, and if not, we would use an arithmetic mean, etc...
