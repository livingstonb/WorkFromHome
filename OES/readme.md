# OES

## Required inputs

To run *stats/code/stats2017.do*, only the following is necessary:

* *build/input/nat3d2017.xlsx*

Otherwise, various other years are required, which can be downloaded from the BLS. I rename the cross-ownership employment-by-industry files as *nat#d####*, followed by the original extension, where the first \# symbol is the digit at which industries are aggregated and the four symbols at the end represent the year.
