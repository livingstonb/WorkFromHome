\section{Model}
Let $m_{s,t}$ be one of Google's measure of the \% difference of mobility from baseline, where $s$ is state and $t$ is day. Then define our baseline value of mobility for state $s$ as $m_s^0$, the mean of $m_{s,t}$ between 2/22 and 3/7 for workplaces and between 2/29 and 3/7 for retail and recreation, excluding weekends in both cases. Similarly, define our terminal value for mobility for state $s$ as
$m_s^T$, the mean of $m_{s,t}$ between the day after the stay-at-home order and the 4/11, both inclusive.
Then consider a variable:
$$
y_{st} = \begin{cases}
0, &  t = 0 \\
m_{s,t} - m_s^0, & t \in \{1, \ldots, T_s-1\} \\
m_s^T - m_s^0, & t = T_s
\end{cases}
$$

Our model is the following:
\begin{align*}
\Delta y_{s,t} = \beta + \alpha' D_{s,t} + \theta' I_{s,t} + \epsilon_{s,t}
\end{align*}
where $D_{s,t}$ contains dummies for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday; and $I_{s,t}$ contains three dummies for each of the four interventions: a lag, a contemporaneous term, and a lead.

\subsection{Estimate of the fall in mobility not attributable to the interventions}
Fix a state $s$, and assume the following expectations are taken conditional on $s$, which is associated with $T$ time periods in our data. The estimate is the following, where $NI$ (no-interventions) implies conditioning on $I_{s,t}$ being equal to zero for each time period:
\begin{align*}
\text{E}_{NI}\left[y_{s,T} - y_{s,0}\right] &=
\text{E}_{NI}\left[\sum_{t=1}^T \Delta y_{s,T}\right] \\
&= \beta T + \alpha' \sum_{t=1}^T D_{s,t}
\end{align*}
